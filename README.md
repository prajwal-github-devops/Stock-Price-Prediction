Stock Price Prediction Using Pandas and PyCaret
This project predicts stock prices using Pandas for data manipulation and PyCaret for low-code machine learning. Historical stock data is processed, analyzed, and modeled to forecast future prices.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured historical stock data using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends and key stock metrics.
Modeling: Built and compared regression models with PyCaret to predict stock prices.
Repository Structure
data: Contains historical stock price data (spy.csv).
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training.
scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing and prediction.
